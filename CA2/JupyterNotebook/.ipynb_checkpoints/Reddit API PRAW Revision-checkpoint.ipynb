The short answer, use ChatGPT or bard, etc... The more detailed answer, it\\'s complicated. Most of the programming languages have different native functions and different libraries. Just by seeing how to \"translate\" certain functions(for example curve_fit from scipy) cannot be done, but there are other libraries in each language that can do the job. So, it is possible to translate some raw code without using libraries and if you want to use special libraries, you need to figure out what are the differences between them and apply manually the changes. Also, it depends what you want to do. If you are doing data analysis, maybe it\\'s not necessary to move to another language. If you are looking for better performance, you can try to use numba or move completely the project to another language. Hope this helps you!',\n",

Problem number one: it doesn\\'t work. I cannot run your README examples:\\n\\n    import PhysiPy.Electricity as ec\\n    >> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \\'PhysiPy.Electricity\\'\\n\\nOkay, maybe just outdated docs. I\\'ll jump in to the code and find out what\\'s going on... and your `__init__.py` is empty... so this in fact was *never* going to work, it\\'s not just outdated docs.\\n\\nI fixed your `__init__.py` so I could at least try things out - this is beyond the point, by the way, that I\\'d already have dustbinned this library if I were wanting to actually use it. I attempt to use the function I see: `weight(mass)`\\n\\n    NameError: name \\'math\\' is not defined\\n\\n1. Is this yet another problem I need to fix in order to multiply mass by gravity?\\n2. I thought this was \"extremely fast\" due to using Numpy? Why are we calling `math`? I smell future problems\\n\\nI now have to fix your imports in [`constants.py`](https://constants.py) too - noticing along the way that there\\'s a blank [`derivations.py`](https://derivations.py) sitting there? I guess at least that file can\\'t have errors. Pardon the frustrated sarcasm.\\n\\n    import PhysiPy as pp\\n    pp.weight(10) \\n    >> 98.0\\n\\nFinally! After all that messing around, we have an actual numeric output. Not very *good* numeric output considering this is a physics library - are we really using `g = 9.8`? Maybe this is an outlier.\\n\\nLet\\'s try some more\\n\\n    sun_mass = 2E30\\n    earth_mass = 5.972E24 \\n    earth_orbit_radius = 1.496E11 \\n    pp.Gravitation.G(sun_mass, earth_mass, earth_orbit_radius) \\n    >> 3.5618695987874973e+22\\n\\nThat\\'s about right for those parameters. Cool :)\\n\\n    width = 100\\n    height = 20 \\n    area = pp.area(width, height) \\n    depth = 40 \\n    volume = depth * area \\n    >> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: \\'int\\' and \\'NoneType\\'\\n\\n...not cool. Let\\'s try another.\\n\\n    def wave_particle_duality(wavelength, momentum): ...\\n\\nHold on, those two quantities are related by a constant as per de Broglie. If I know one I should be calculating the other, but if I already know both the most I could do is calculate the Planck constant, no?\\n\\n    wavelength = 1.47E-34\\n    mass = 0.15 \\n    velocity = 30 \\n    momentum = pp.Mechanics.momentum(mass, velocity)\\n    pp.QuantumMechanics.wave_particle_duality(wavelength, momentum) \\n    >> False\\n\\nWhat? What is this actually meant to do?\\n\\nIf I\\'m being very charitable, perhaps this is meant to just verify that I\\'ve done my de Broglie calcs correctly and output `True` if so. Let\\'s try that.\\n\\n    wavelength = pp.QuantumMechanics.de_broglie_wavelength_particle(momentum)\\n    pp.QuantumMechanics.wave_particle_duality(wavelength, momentum) \\n    >> True\\n\\nAt least there\\'s some kind of internal consistency.

Maybe I\\'m looking at an unfinished version? The vast majority of this is linear or trivial polynomial combinations of the inputs to your functions. Having those functions available is neat if the user doesn\\'t want to remember them, but the functions are incomplete, there are no tests that I can see to verify their correctness, and if you *had* written any tests they wouldn\\'t pass because it\\'s just... wrong. That\\'s assuming that if I want to calculate `f = m*a` and I would prefer to write `f = PhysiPi.Nlm.force(m, a)` rather than just `f = m*a`\\n\\nI don\\'t get it, dude. What is this?

       "  {'comment': 'There is so much that\\'s wrong in this code that it\\'s difficult to know where to begin.\\n\\nLet me start by ignoring the code and addressing the question.\\n\\nTo write a function, in Python, that accepts a single argument (for which you intend that callers supply a two item tuple) you can do something like this:\\n\\ndef fun(t):\\n    try:\\n        a, b = t\\n    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\\n        print(\\'Must supply a tuple or other iterable yielding two values\\', file-sys.stderr)\\n        raise\\n    return a+b\\n\\nWe could call this with:  fun((1,2))  … NOTE THE DOUBLED PARENTHESES.\\n\\nThe point here is that we must supply a two-item, tuple, or list, or other sequence or iterable object as our argument.  That argument will be mapped to the function\\'s single parameter t.\\n\\nAcademic note:  functions are defined in terms of parameters and invoked with arguments.  That distinction is often blurred in discussions about programming.\\n\\nIn this example function we\\'re unpacking the argument (which has been passed through the parameter named t) into the local variables (names): a and b.  I\\'ve provided some simple error handling as an example.  It\\'s not what you should do for any production quality code; but it illustrates the technique. (This sample error handling also assumes that you\\'ll im;ort the sys module to provide the sys.stderr output stream)\\n\\nIn this exception handling example we\\'re dealing with two sorts of issue, an argument of an invalid type (not an iterable, we can\\'t extract multiple values out of it like we can with a tuple) or an iterable yielding the wrong number of values (too many or too few items).\\n\\nYou could also \"destructure\" (unpack) these arguments into separate parameters like so:\\n\\ndef fun2(a,b):\\n    return a+b\\n\\nThen given a sequence of 2-item tuples (or other suitable iterables) like: [(1,2),(3,5),(4,2)] you would have to unpack each in the code (loop) calling fun2() like so:\\n\\nfor this, that in mylist_of_tuples:\\n    fun2(this, that)\\n\\nNote:  you\\'d have to ensure that every item of your data list was properly structured for this destructuring.  To add the equivalent error handling from the previous example we have to iterate over the items without the concise unpacking (destructuring) and do it within try: … except: … nested within our loop:\\n\\nfor each in my_data:\\n    try:\\n        # see previous examples \\n    except # see previous example \\n\\nGetting back to your code, the most significant issue is that you\\'re evaluating a return statement within your loop.  This will return the first results of your processing of the first item passed to your fucks() function (and thus exiting the loop and the whole function call context).\\n\\nI just tried experimentally pasting your code into a couple of chat AI systems to see if they could save me some typing.  Google Bard currently refuses to try code analysis.  Phind gave me these results:\\n\\nhttps://www.phind.com/search?cache=bae74vjac66zktpfqozyyb2p\\n\\n… this is literally the first time I\\'ve tried that engine and I have no idea of this link will be useful.\\n\\nHere\\'s a session with ChatGPT 3.5 (not sure what these look like either; haven\\'t attempted sharing such sessions before):\\n\\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/ef51468e-86d3-408f-8c12-9d254bd7a13c\\n\\nYou can easily see where I prompted ChatGPT with much more follow up.\\n\\nI encourage everyone to try various chat AI systems to see if they help.  Of course I offer this suggestion with all die caveats.  Don\\'t trust any code or facts generated by chat systems and don\\'t trust them with any confidential nor sensitive data.',\n",

The short answer, use ChatGPT or bard, etc... The more detailed answer, it\\'s complicated. Most of the programming languages have different native functions and different libraries. Just by seeing how to \"translate\" certain functions(for example curve_fit from scipy) cannot be done, but there are other libraries in each language that can do the job. So, it is possible to translate some raw code without using libraries and if you want to use special libraries, you need to figure out what are the differences between them and apply manually the changes. Also, it depends what you want to do. If you are doing data analysis, maybe it\\'s not necessary to move to another language. If you are looking for better performance, you can try to use numba or move completely the project to another language. Hope this helps you!',\n",

       "  {'comment': 'There is so much that\\'s wrong in this code that it\\'s difficult to know where to begin.\\n\\nLet me start by ignoring the code and addressing the question.\\n\\nTo write a function, in Python, that accepts a single argument (for which you intend that callers supply a two item tuple) you can do something like this:\\n\\ndef fun(t):\\n    try:\\n        a, b = t\\n    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\\n        print(\\'Must supply a tuple or other iterable yielding two values\\', file-sys.stderr)\\n        raise\\n    return a+b\\n\\nWe could call this with:  fun((1,2))  … NOTE THE DOUBLED PARENTHESES.\\n\\nThe point here is that we must supply a two-item, tuple, or list, or other sequence or iterable object as our argument.  That argument will be mapped to the function\\'s single parameter t.\\n\\nAcademic note:  functions are defined in terms of parameters and invoked with arguments.  That distinction is often blurred in discussions about programming.\\n\\nIn this example function we\\'re unpacking the argument (which has been passed through the parameter named t) into the local variables (names): a and b.  I\\'ve provided some simple error handling as an example.  It\\'s not what you should do for any production quality code; but it illustrates the technique. (This sample error handling also assumes that you\\'ll im;ort the sys module to provide the sys.stderr output stream)\\n\\nIn this exception handling example we\\'re dealing with two sorts of issue, an argument of an invalid type (not an iterable, we can\\'t extract multiple values out of it like we can with a tuple) or an iterable yielding the wrong number of values (too many or too few items).\\n\\nYou could also \"destructure\" (unpack) these arguments into separate parameters like so:\\n\\ndef fun2(a,b):\\n    return a+b\\n\\nThen given a sequence of 2-item tuples (or other suitable iterables) like: [(1,2),(3,5),(4,2)] you would have to unpack each in the code (loop) calling fun2() like so:\\n\\nfor this, that in mylist_of_tuples:\\n    fun2(this, that)\\n\\nNote:  you\\'d have to ensure that every item of your data list was properly structured for this destructuring.  To add the equivalent error handling from the previous example we have to iterate over the items without the concise unpacking (destructuring) and do it within try: … except: … nested within our loop:\\n\\nfor each in my_data:\\n    try:\\n        # see previous examples \\n    except # see previous example \\n\\nGetting back to your code, the most significant issue is that you\\'re evaluating a return statement within your loop.  This will return the first results of your processing of the first item passed to your fucks() function (and thus exiting the loop and the whole function call context).\\n\\nI just tried experimentally pasting your code into a couple of chat AI systems to see if they could save me some typing.  Google Bard currently refuses to try code analysis.  Phind gave me these results:\\n\\nhttps://www.phind.com/search?cache=bae74vjac66zktpfqozyyb2p\\n\\n… this is literally the first time I\\'ve tried that engine and I have no idea of this link will be useful.\\n\\nHere\\'s a session with ChatGPT 3.5 (not sure what these look like either; haven\\'t attempted sharing such sessions before):\\n\\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/ef51468e-86d3-408f-8c12-9d254bd7a13c\\n\\nYou can easily see where I prompted ChatGPT with much more follow up.\\n\\nI encourage everyone to try various chat AI systems to see if they help.  Of course I offer this suggestion with all die caveats.  Don\\'t trust any code or facts generated by chat systems and don\\'t trust them with any confidential nor sensitive data.',\n",
